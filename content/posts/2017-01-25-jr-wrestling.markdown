Last Sunday was a rough day for both me and my son (Ahas). Ahas ended up loosing all wrestling matches in the tournament. I have clearly set both of our expectation not for the wins but for doing his 
best. I was disappointed because I felt like Ahas was not doing his best. After the tournament I asked him why didnâ€™t he gave his best. That made him so upset. He repeatedly told me that he gave his 
best. That night I had time to reflect. I came up with better ideas for dealing with his losses.

1. I should not be the judge of whether Ahas gave his best or not. I can question him to ask if he gave his best and should be ready accept his answer.

1. I should be appreciative of his effort to get out there and wrestle.

1. We (Both me and Ahas) need to come up with `SMART` goals for him to achieve during tournaments.

~~~
S - Specific
M - Measurable
A - Agreed Upon
R - Realistic
T - Time based
~~~

  For example:

~~~
1. Not let opponent pin him.
2. Try to score 3 points.
3. Try to stay 1 min before ending this game.
~~~

I'm going to give these ideas a try for coming tournament.

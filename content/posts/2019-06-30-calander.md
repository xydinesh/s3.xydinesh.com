I use [`Samsara`](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/samsara-timer/id592333521) app to time meditations. I started with 20 min each day. I'm trying to do 40 - 60 min every day. Above chart and summary shows statistics for the month of June 2019. At the moment, I have 45 consecative days that I meditated. Consecative days has become a good motivator to keep up my practice.

In the past I have considered giving up maintaining a blog myself and moving to medium. I have seen many bloggers moved to medium. Also, I found myself 
reading more and more medium articles. Recently, medium started putting a pay wall on the articles that I'm reading. Asking me to upgrade to a premium account.

I get that medium wants paid users to maintain thier infrastructure and cover costs. I still believe bloggers/publishers don't mind publishing their content for free. 
That's a very good reason for me to not to move to medium. I want content I'm publishing to available to anyone for free. I don't want my readers to pay for ads, platform or anything.

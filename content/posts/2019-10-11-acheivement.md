I still remember struggling to deadlift 95lb in open workout 18.4, spend weekend with ice packs on my back. It was embarrassing to say the least. It was my first month in crossfit. I told myself, I don’t have anything to prove, this will be a benchmark for my future self. Today I had an opportunity to benchmark myself for the first time in an open workout. 

```
20.1
----
10 rounds for time of:
	8 ground-to-overheads, 95 lb.
	10 bar-facing burpees
Time cap: 15 minutes
```

20.1 workout is a brutal workout where bar facing burpees test you to the limit. I managed to do only 5 rounds 3 reps, a total of 93 reps. I’m at the lower end of the Rx. Still, It is an achievement as I managed to Rx. 

From struggling to deadlift 95lb, to getting 95lb overhead from ground in 18 months is a clear improvement in techniques and strength. I guess, I can get a burrito to treat myself tonight to celebrate this achievement. 

As I read somewhere: Nothing is what you think it is, you give everything it's meaning and all excuses are bullshit. Including my excuse to eat a burrito tonight.

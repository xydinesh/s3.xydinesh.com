title: "Common Lisp Rest API"

After reading Paul Graham's "Hackers and Painters", I wanted learn "Common Lisp". I found "lisp-koans" to be a great resource for me to get started.
After completing about 25 lessons of 27 koans, I wanted to try and create a REST api project with lisp. I found creating a REST API to be a difficult
taks because I didn't know much about project structure and how to move forward with a lisp project. Therefore I decided to document the process I folowed
to help someone else to get started. This may not be the best approach but it should help you to get started and move along with a REST API development.

## Installing and Setup Environment.

I'm using `sbcl` as "Common Lisp" implementation and `Quicklisp` for package management. [Lisp Cookbook](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/getting-started.html#install-quicklisp) `Getting Started` guide provides a good starting point for installing `Lisp` and `Quicklisp` package manager.

```
brew install sbcl
brew install rlwrap
curl -O https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp
sbcl --load quicklisp.lisp
```

After "Common Lisp" REPL loads

```
(quicklisp-quickstart:install)
(ql:add-to-init-file)
```

In order to install quickproject,

```
(ql:quickload "quickproject")
```

## Create new project

I found that location that I create new project is important if I want to load it from the `sbcl` REPL after I make changes. We are going to create a new project `cl-start` in `~/quicklisp/local-projects` so that `quicklisp` able to discover and load this project without any issues. In addition, we will be using `Hunchentoot`

```
(quickproject:make-project "~/quicklisp/local-projects/cl-start" :depends-on '(hunchentoot))
WARNING: Coercing "~/quicklisp/local-projects/cl-start" to directory
"cl-start"
```

```
$tree ~/quicklisp/local-projects/cl-start
├── README.md
├── cl-start.asd
├── cl-start.lisp
└── package.lisp
```

Since we added project at `~/quicklisp/local-projects` we can load our project with `(ql:quickload "cl-start")`

## Common Lisp REST hello world

Add following code to cl-start.lisp

```
;;;; cl-start.lisp

(in-package #:cl-start)

;; Add a simple prefix dispatcher to the *dispatch-table*
(setq *dispatch-table*
      `(,(create-prefix-dispatcher "/hello" 'hello-page)))

;; Handler functions either return generated Web pages as strings,
;; or write to the output stream returned by write-headers
(defun hello-page ()
  "Hello !")

(defun main ()
  (start (make-instance 'easy-acceptor :port 8080))
  (sb-thread:join-thread (find-if
                          (lambda (th)
                            (string= (sb-thread:thread-name th) "hunchentoot-listener-*:8080"))
                          (sb-thread:list-all-threads))))
```

`package.lisp` contains following

```
;;;; package.lisp
(ql:quickload '(:hunchentoot))

(defpackage #:cl-start
  (:use #:cl #:hunchentoot)
    (:export :main))
```

## Makefile for creating an executable

Create a makefile with following content.

```
all: build
build:
        sbcl --load cl-start.asd \
        --eval '(ql:quickload :cl-start)' \
        --eval "(sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die #p\"cl-start\" :toplevel #'cl-start:main :executable t)"
```

## Compile and Running Server

```
make

sbcl --load cl-start.asd \
        --eval '(ql:quickload :cl-start)' \
        --eval "(sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die #p\"cl-start\" :toplevel #'cl-start:main :executable t)"
This is SBCL 1.5.8, an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp.

```

Above `make` command will create a `cl-start` executable that we use to run our HTTP Server

```
./cl-start
```

## client requests

On another window use `curl`  to send http requests to the server.

```
http "http://localhost:8080/hello"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Length: 7
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

Keep-Alive: timeout=20
Server: Hunchentoot 1.2.38

Hello !
```
